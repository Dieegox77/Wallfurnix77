Requirements:

1) Python >= 3.2:
	Download and install. In the last screen of the installer, check "Add to PATH" and "Disable path length limit"
	Link: python.org/downloads

2) G-Python & PyQt5:
	Run "install_components.bat" from the "readme" folder and follow the instructions

-----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

1) Connect G-Earth
2) Run "Wallfurnix77.bat" and accept the popup that will appear

To select a poster, move it anywhere
- / + modify the coordinates by 1 unit
- / ++ modify the coordinates by 10 units
--- / +++ modify the coordinates by 100 units
To enter a value manually, write it in the text box and click "Set"
"Reset" returns the poster to its original position
"Move to last" moves the current poster to the position of the previous poster set with the extension

-----------------------------------------------------------

Updating:

When Habbo updates headers, the extension will stop working :( 
To fix it, overwrite the new ID of the MoveWallItem packet in the "header.txt" file
